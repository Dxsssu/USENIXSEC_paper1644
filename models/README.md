# Models Directory

This directory stores local model artifacts used by SOCRATES.

## 1. Vectorization + business self-learning model (Module 2)

Place the Module 2 model artifact here, typically:

- `business_self_learning_xgboost.pkl`

By default, the path is configured as:

- `module2.model.model_path = models/business_self_learning_xgboost.pkl`

This artifact is generated by Module 2 training and includes:

- the trained XGBoost classifier
- `feature_state` used to reproduce the same alert vectorization pipeline during online inference
  (structural + semantic + temporal features)

## 2. LLM model directory (Module 3)

Place the local LLM checkpoint directory here, by default:

- `Qwen3-32B/`

By default, the path is configured as:

- `module3.llm.model_path = models/Qwen3-32B`

The directory should be loadable by `transformers` (`AutoTokenizer` and `AutoModelForCausalLM`).
If you want to use another model (for example `Qwen3-14B` or `Qwen3-30B-A3B`), update `module3.llm.model_path` accordingly.

## Notes

- This repository does not include full model weights.
- Please download or prepare required model files locally before running the pipeline.
