# SOCRATES: An AI-Powered SOC Agent for Automated Network Alert Triage

## Abstract

Modern Security Operations Centers (SOCs) are increasingly overwhelmed by a deluge of network security alerts, the
vast majority of which are false positives. This phenomenon,
known as alert fatigue, severely degrades the efficiency of security analysts and increases the risk of overlooking genuine
threats. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown
promise in semantic understanding, their direct application
to real-world alert triage is hindered by prohibitive inference
latency and high false positive rates due to a lack of enterprise-specific context. In this paper, we propose SOCRATES, an
AI-powered SOC agent designed for automated and scalable
network alert triage. SOCRATES employs a staged, coarse-to-fine processing pipeline that integrates three core components: (1) a lightweight aggregation and filtering module to
consolidate redundant alerts, (2) a business logic self-learning
module that leverages XGBoost to suppress recurring benign
activities, and (3) a context-enhanced LLM investigation module that performs evidence-grounded reasoning by retrieving
internal asset metadata and external threat intelligence. Experimental results demonstrate that SOCRATES achieves a
significant workload reduction ratio of 95.22% while maintaining high detection integrity, retaining 99.63% of true attacks with an F1-score of 82.48%. Furthermore, real-world
deployment over one year confirms that SOCRATES reduces
manual investigation effort by over 80%, providing a scalable, interpretable, and effective solution for modern security
operations.

## 1 Introduction

With the increasing sophistication and automation of cyberattacks, modern enterprises are facing an ever-growing and
increasingly complex threat landscape. To effectively detect
and mitigate malicious activities, organizations have deployed
a wide range of security devices, including Web Application Firewalls (WAFs) [25], Intrusion Detection Systems
(IDSs) [6], and Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPSs) [22].
While these security devices significantly enhance defensive
visibility, they paradoxically give rise to a severe problem
known as
alert fatigue
[5,13,15,33]. In large-scale enterprise
environments, they routinely generate millions of alerts on a
daily basis, far exceeding the processing capacity of human
analysts, with over 99% of these alerts ultimately identified
as false positives [1,3,41]. To alleviate this burden, industry
practices have extensively adopted heuristic-based detection
techniques as well as traditional machine learning and deep
learning paradigms [4,34,36]. However, these approaches
remain constrained by inherent limitations [31]. Rule-based
systems are rigid and costly to maintain, requiring continuous manual updates to keep pace with evolving attack patterns [38]. Data-driven learning models, on the other hand,
often operate as black boxes, lacking the interpretability necessary for analysts to trust their decisions. Moreover, such
models typically fail to capture the deep semantic structure of
alert logs or to correlate attacker behaviors across contextual
dimensions, resulting in missed detections of sophisticated
and stealthy threats.
Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in semantic understanding and
contextual reasoning [14,17], enabling them to interpret complex data with a level of flexibility previously unattainable by
traditional learning models. Their ability to process heterogeneous inputs and reason over long textual contexts makes
them especially attractive for security analysis tasks [28],
where alerts often contain rich but fragmented semantic information distributed across logs, payloads, and metadata.
Beyond general natural language tasks, LLMs have already
shown promising results across multiple cybersecurity domains [40], such as automated penetration testing [8,30],
vulnerability discovery and analysis [19,24,42], and security
policy auditing. LLMs have been increasingly explored as
a potential paradigm for automating security workflows and
bridging the gap between low-level alert data and high-level
human reasoning.

### Research Gaps

Despite the significant potential of LLMs,
directly applying them to real-world alert classification and
triage scenarios remains challenging [39]. Through empirical investigation and practical consideration of industrial
Security Operations Centers (SOCs) environments, we identify two critical research gaps that fundamentally hinder the
deployment of LLM-based solutions in production settings:
excessive false positives
and
prohibitive inference latency
.
On the one hand, standalone LLMs suffer from persistently
high false positive rates when operating without sufficient
contextual knowledge [9]. Enterprise environments often exhibit business-specific behaviors that closely resemble genuine attack patterns, such as authorized vulnerability scanning,
internal testing, or customized application workflows. In the
absence of enterprise-aware context, LLMs struggle to disambiguate these benign activities from real threats. Moreover,
LLMs tend to adopt a conservative decision-making bias,
frequently defaulting to classifying ambiguous alerts as malicious. This behavior significantly amplifies false positives,
undermining the primary objective of alert triage, which is to
reduce analyst workload while preserving detection effectiveness. On the other hand, the inference latency of LLMs poses
a severe scalability bottleneck [2,21]. Even under optimized
deployment reminders, evaluating a single alert typically requires several seconds of processing time, especially when
advanced reasoning strategies are employed. Such per-alert
latency is fundamentally incompatible with operational SOC
environments, where security infrastructures routinely generate alerts at the scale of millions per day. As a result, directly
applying LLMs to perform deep reasoning over every incoming alert would incur unacceptable delays and computational
costs, rendering naive LLM-based triage approaches impractical for large-scale, high-throughput settings.
To address these challenges, we propose SOCRATES, an
AI-powered SOC agent designed to automate the network
alert triage process. SOCRATES integrates techniques like
lightweight filtering and aggregation, enterprise-aware behavior modeling, and context-enhanced reasoning to effectively
manage the alert overload in SOCs. By intelligently reducing alert volume and incorporating contextual knowledge,
SOCRATES helps mitigate false positives while enhancing
the precision of alert classifications, providing a scalable solution to the growing problem of alert fatigue in modern
enterprises.

### Technical Challenges

There are three major technical challenges in developing SOCRATES:
How can computationally expensive LLM reasoning be
scaled to handle massive volumes of alerts?
Modern SOC
infrastructures generate alerts at an extremely high rate, often reaching millions of events per day. Directly applying
LLM-based deep reasoning to every incoming alert is computationally infeasible due to strict latency constraints and
prohibitive resource costs. The challenge lies in designing
a scalable processing pipeline that can efficiently reduce
alert volume while preserving critical security signals, ensuring that intensive LLM reasoning is reserved only for
high-value and contextually meaningful alerts.
How can the system accurately capture enterprise-specific
business semantics?
A significant portion of false positives in alert triage originates from legitimate enterprise
activities that closely resemble malicious behavior, such as
authorized scanning, internal testing, or customized application workflows. These behaviors are often highly specific
to individual organizations and evolve over time, making
them difficult to model using static rules or generic threat
intelligence. Without an effective mechanism to learn and
adapt to enterprise-specific business logic, an automated
triage system risks systematically misclassifying benign
activities as attacks, thereby failing to reduce alert fatigue.
How can the system equip LLMs with sufficient alertcentric context to support reliable triage decisions under
uncertainty?
Security alert triage requires more than accurate pattern recognition; it fundamentally depends on the
availability of relevant contextual information surrounding
an alert. When operating in isolation, standalone LLMs are
forced to reason over incomplete and fragmented evidence,
making them prone to conservative bias and speculative
judgments. In real-world SOC environments, a single alert
is rarely self-contained and often needs to be interpreted in
conjunction with related alerts, asset context, and external
knowledge sources. Without access to such alert-centric
context, LLMs struggle to assess intent, scope, and severity,
resulting in unreliable decisions and elevated false positives. Designing a system that can systematically retrieve,
integrate, and reason over relevant contextual information,
while producing interpretable verdicts grounded in concrete evidence, remains a critical technical challenge.

### Key Insights

To address these challenges, SOCRATES incorporates several key insights and techniques:
Insight 1: Coarse-to-Fine Alert Reduction via

### Lightweight Filtering and Aggregation

Applying deep
reasoning to every alert is neither necessary nor feasible at
scale. An important insight is that the majority of raw alerts
are low-fidelity, redundant, or semantically similar. By
employing lightweight filtering and aggregation techniques
to remove noise and cluster related alerts, the system can
drastically reduce alert volume while preserving critical
security signals. This coarse-to-fine processing strategy
ensures that computationally expensive LLM reasoning is
reserved only for a small set of high-value candidate alerts,
effectively overcoming scalability and latency constraints.
Insight 2: Enterprise-Aware Behavior Modeling
through Self-Learning.
Rather than relying on static
rules or generic threat intelligence, effective alert triage
requires an understanding of enterprise-specific operational
semantics. A key insight is that benign business behaviors
that trigger alerts are often repetitive and exhibit stable
patterns over time. By continuously learning from
historical alert data and traffic characteristics, the system
can construct adaptive baselines of normal enterprise
behavior. This enables the identification and suppression of
alerts originating from legitimate but attack-like activities,
directly addressing the challenge of high false positive
rates caused by the lack of enterprise context.
Insight 3: Context-Grounded Reasoning through Alert-

### Centric Context Enrichment

Accurate triage decisions
depend on more than the content of an isolated alert; they
require access to relevant contextual evidence. A central
insight is that LLMs can make more reliable judgments
when equipped with alert-centric context, such as correlated
alerts, asset information, and external knowledge sources.
By explicitly retrieving and integrating such context into the
reasoning process, the system enables evidence-grounded
analysis that reduces speculative inference.

### Contributions

In this work, we propose SOCRATES, an
AI-powered SOC agent designed to automate and optimize
the network alert triage process. SOCRATES addresses the
core challenges identified in the research gaps by introducing
a modular and scalable framework. The system incorporates
three key components: a lightweight alert aggregation and
filtering module, a business logic self-learning module, and
a context-enhanced LLM investigation module. The alert aggregation and filtering module consolidates redundant and
similar alerts, reducing overall volume and ensuring that only
high-value alerts are processed further. The business logic
self-learning module continuously adapts to the enterprise's
specific operations, learning from historical data to suppress
alerts triggered by benign, recurring business activities. This
reduces false positives without relying on static rules. Finally,
the context-enhanced LLM investigation module enriches
alert analysis by retrieving and integrating relevant contextual information, allowing SOCRATES to make evidence-grounded decisions. Together, these components ensure a
balance between efficiency, adaptability, and accuracy, enabling SOCRATES to effectively manage large-scale SOC
environments and alleviate alert fatigue while preserving high
detection performance.

### Evaluation

We evaluate SOCRATES on a large-scale industry arena dataset comprising over 70 million log entries
collected over 21 days from a production enterprise environment. The experimental results demonstrate that SOCRATES
achieves a significant workload reduction ratio of 95.22%,
effectively suppressing 1,846,068 alerts while maintaining
high detection integrity. Compared to traditional alert throttling strategies which incur a catastrophic attack loss rate of
up to 84.36%, SOCRATES retains 99.63% of true attacks
with a negligible loss rate of only 0.37% (187 alerts). Furthermore, by leveraging enterprise-aware context, our system
reduces the false positive rate to 19.35% and achieves an f1score of 82.48%, significantly outperforming standalone LLM
baselines and existing state-of-the-art frameworks. These results confirm that SOCRATES provides accurate, scalable,
and trustworthy triage decisions grounded in comprehensive
evidence, bridging the gap between automated analysis and
human expertise.

## 2 Background & Related Work

2.1 Network Alert Triage
Network alert triage is a fundamental workflow in modern
SOCs, whose objective is to progressively reduce massive
volumes of raw alerts into a small set of confirmed security
incidents. In large-scale enterprise environments, this process is typically organized as a multi-stage, coarse-to-fine
pipeline, as illustrated inFigure 1, which balances scalability
and analytical depth. At the initial stage, SOCs continuously
ingest massive raw alerts generated by heterogeneous security devices such as IDSs and WAFs. These alerts are highly
redundant and noisy, as detection mechanisms are often configured to favor coverage over precision [3]. To cope with
this scale, SOC platforms first apply coarse-grained filtering,
such as whitelist and blacklist matching, alert suppression,
and deduplication, to rapidly eliminate obvious noise with
minimal overhead [26]. Alerts that survive this stage remain
unverified and require further analysis. Subsequently, the alert
triage stage focuses on semantic understanding of alert payloads and contextual metadata to assess potential malicious
intent. This stage aims to distinguish genuinely suspicious
activities from benign anomalies that resemble attacks, producing a smaller set of highly suspicious alerts. These alerts
are then escalated to the investigation and validation stage,
where correlation across multiple data sources, such as historical alerts, asset context, and threat intelligence, is performed
to determine whether an alert constitutes a confirmed security
incident. This progressive triage paradigm reflects a key operational principle in SOCs: early stages prioritize throughput
and noise reduction, while later stages emphasize accuracy
and contextual reasoning. However, traditional alert triage
pipelines rely heavily on static rules and manual analysis,
limiting their ability to adapt to enterprise-specific behaviors and motivating more intelligent and context-aware triage
mechanisms.
2.2 LLM Applications in Cybersecurity
Most LLMs are built on the transformer architecture [37]. The
key innovation of this architecture lies in the self-attention
mechanism, which allows the model to evaluate the relative
importance of different words in the input text and capture
long-range dependencies and complex contextual relationships. These models are pre-trained on massive and diverse
text corpora to learn the task of predicting the next word
in a sequence. As a result, they develop a strong ability to
understand meaning in language [43]. This emerging capacity for deep semantic understanding enables LLMs to interpret the implications and intentions behind semi-structured
texts, such as the payloads in network alerts. The powerful

text understanding and reasoning capabilities of LLMs have
catalyzed a wave of innovation within the cybersecurity domain [11,40]. Beyond simple text classification, LLMs are
now being explored for a wide range of complex cybersecurity tasks, including threat intelligence analysis [23,32],
malware code dissection [10,16], penetration testing [8,29],
and incident response plan formulation [18]. Recognizing
this potential, several cybersecurity and technology companies have begun developing their own security-specific LLMs.
For instance, Microsoft has introduced Security Copilot [27],
Google has developed Sec-PaLM as part of its Security AI
Workbench [12], and CrowdStrike has launched Charlotte
AI [7]. These models are typically trained on massive proprietary cybersecurity datasets and provide more accurate
security analysis.

## 3 Exploratory Study

To investigate the inherent boundaries of LLMs in network
alert triage and establish a baseline for subsequent comparison, we first conducted an exploratory study. This evaluation, as illustrated inFigure 2, focuses on the performance
of LLMs operating in a standalone mode, where the models
lack access to external context such as threat intelligence and
asset databases, or specialized security tools. This baseline
assessment addresses the following two Research Questions
(RQs):
RQ1(Performance):
How effective are standalone LLMs
in performing network alert triage?
RQ2(Bottlenecks):
What are the primary limitations of
LLMs during the alert triage process?
We first introduce the curation and preprocessing of our
real-world alert dataset in 3.1. Next, we outline the experimental configuration, including the specific LLMs and
prompting strategies tested, in 3.2. Finally, we present the
empirical results and provide an in-depth analysis of the performance bottlenecks in 3.3.
Figure 2: The experimental pipeline of our exploratory study
and gap analysis.
3.1 Data Preparation
We collaborated with a partner enterprise to curate a benchmark dataset derived from a production IDS. The raw data
collection spans a continuous period of six months and originally comprised millions of alert logs generated within the
SOC. Through rigorous preprocessing and deduplication, we
extracted a high-quality subset of alerts that preserves essential attributes for triage, such as timestamps, source and
destination IP addresses, protocols, and raw payload content,
as illustrated inTable 1. To establish a reliable ground truth
for evaluation, senior security analysts were engaged to manually inspect and cross-validate each alert instance. We strictly
balanced the collection to eliminate class bias, yielding a final
dataset of 4,000 distinct samples. This corpus contains exactly
2,000 confirmed malicious incidents labeled as True Attack
and 2,000 benign anomalies labeled as False Positive.
3.2 Evaluation Setup

### Model Selection

Regarding model selection, we prioritized state-of-the-art open-source models suitable for privacysensitive enterprise environments. To rigorously investigate the impact of parameter scaling and underlying model
structures on triage performance, we focused specifically
on the Qwen3 family. This selection includes both standard

).

of LLMs is heavily contingent upon input formulation, we

conducted on a standardized hardware environment equipped
with a single 80GB NVIDIA A100 GPU. We assess model
efficacy using standard classification metrics, including True

we record the Average Processing Time per alert to gauge
operational efficiency.

semantic reasoning ability to recognize attack-like patterns
in raw network alerts. However, this high recall comes at the
cost of poor precision. As shown in the Avg row ofTable 2,
the average FPR remains as high as 61.83%, with several
configurations exceeding 60%. In the context of SOCs, where
the primary goal of alert triage is to reduce analyst workload
rather than maximize detection coverage, such a high false
positive rate is operationally unacceptable. These results indicate that while standalone LLMs are effective at flagging
suspicious activity, they fail to reliably distinguish true threats
from benign anomalies, limiting their practical utility for alert
triage.
Answer to RQ2: Bottlenecks in Alert Triage with LLMs.
The experimental results, combined with a manual inspection
of model outputs, reveal two fundamental bottlenecks that
limit the applicability of standalone LLMs for alert triage:
high false positive rates and prohibitive inference latency.
From the perspective of false positives, our analysis shows
that LLMs struggle to accurately distinguish malicious attacks from benign enterprise-specific activities that closely
resemble attack behaviors. Through manual examination of
the CoT reasoning traces, we observe that many misclassifications arise from the absence of essential contextual knowledge
about enterprise environments. Certain legitimate business
operations, such as authorized vulnerability scanning, internal
testing, or customized application workflows, exhibit traffic
patterns that are syntactically and semantically similar to real
attacks. Lacking access to enterprise-specific context, LLMs
are unable to reliably disambiguate such cases and tend to default to conservative judgments. This bias toward classifying
ambiguous alerts as attacks systematically inflates the false
positive rate.
In terms of efficiency, the inference latency of LLMs
presents a significant operational bottleneck. Even under optimized local deployment, the inference latency per alert is
substantial, ranging from approximately 5 seconds to over
130 seconds depending on the reasoning strategy. This latency
is fundamentally incompatible with real-world SOC environments, where millions of alerts may be generated on a daily
basis. As a result, directly applying LLMs to perform per-alert
deep reasoning at scale would introduce unacceptable delays
and computational costs, rendering standalone LLM-based
triage impractical in high-throughput settings.

## 4 Methodology

This section describes the overall methodology of
SOCRATES, a modular and scalable alert triage framework
designed to address the practical challenges of excessive
false positives and limited reasoning capacity in real-world
SOC environments. Instead of applying computationally
expensive LLM reasoning to all incoming alerts, SOCRATES
adopts a staged, coarse-to-fine processing pipeline that
progressively reduces alert volume while incrementally
enhancing semantic and contextual understanding. As
illustrated inFigure 3, the methodology consists of three
sequential modules. First, a lightweight alert aggregation and
filtering module ( 4.1) efficiently consolidates redundant
alerts and suppresses low-value noise at scale, serving as the
system's front-line throughput control. Second, a business
self-learning module ( 4.2) models enterprise-specific
benign behavior patterns from historical alerts, enabling
the system to identify and suppress business-induced false
positives that are difficult to capture with static rules. Finally,
an alert contextenhanced LLM investigation module ( 4.3)
performs evidence-grounded reasoning over a small subset
of high-value alerts by integrating enriched contextual
information, producing interpretable and analyst-aligned
triage decisions.
4.1
Lightweight Alert Aggregation and Filtering
In large-scale SOC environments, raw alerts generated by
heterogeneous security devices are often highly redundant
and temporally correlated, resulting in substantial low-value
noise. Directly forwarding such high-volume alert streams to
downstream learning or reasoning components is impractical due to scalability and efficiency constraints. To address
this challenge, we introduce a
lightweight alert aggregation
and filtering module
as the first stage of the pipeline, which
performs low-cost consolidation and coarse-grained prioritization to regulate alert throughput for subsequent analysis.
4.1.1 Alert Normalization
To enable efficient alert aggregation and filtering, raw alerts
from heterogeneous security devices are first converted into a
unified and consistent representation through normalization.
We define an alert event model and map all raw alerts into this
common schema, capturing shared structural attributes such
as source and destination identifiers, transport protocol, ports,
rule identifiers, and timestamps, while preserving protocol-specific semantics via dedicated sub-fields (e.g.,
method
,
uri
,
and
status_code
for HTTP alerts, or protocol-relevant flags
for non-HTTP traffic). Optional fields such as
severity
and
confidence
are retained to accommodate device-specific attributes. To reduce superficial syntactic variability among
alerts that exhibit the same underlying behavior, contentbearing fields are further normalized by abstracting instance-specific elements, including numeric values, timestamps, session identifiers, random tokens, hashes, and variable-length
strings, into canonical placeholders (e.g.,
<NUM>
,
<TIME>
,
<SESSION>
,
<TOKEN>
,
<HASH>
) using lightweight pattern-based rules. For HTTP-related alerts, request paths and
query strings are transformed into URI templates by preserving stable path structures while masking variable arguments (e.g.,
/download/tmp/ab93f7c21e4f9a8.log
!
/download/tmp/<TOKEN>.log
). Similar normalization is
applied to payload fragments and headers, ensuring that
protocol-relevant keywords are retained while dynamic values
are abstracted.
4.1.2 Alert Aggregation
After normalization, alerts are aggregated to consolidate redundant events triggered by identical or highly similar activities. This submodule groups alerts based on stable structural
attributes and temporal proximity, producing compact aggregated representations that capture repeated behaviors without
retaining individual alert instances.

### Aggregation key construction

Each alert is assigned to an
aggregation bucket based on a composite key constructed
from stable structural attributes in the unified event model.
Specifically, we define the aggregation key as a tuple of
(
sip
;
dip
;
proto
;
rule_name
;
[
uri_template
])
, where
sip
and
dip
denote the source and destination identifiers,
proto
captures the transport protocol,
rule_name
represents the
triggering detection rule, and
uri_template
, when present,
corresponds to the normalized content template. This key
groups alerts that originate from the same source, target the
same destination, and exhibit equivalent behavioral patterns.

### Field Consolidation

Alerts that share the same aggregation
key are merged within a bounded time interval, such that multiple occurrences of the same alert pattern observed within a
day are represented as a single aggregated alert. During aggregation, we retain a compact representation of the merged
alerts and introduce an explicit reference field that records the
identifiers of all constituent raw alerts. This reference enables
efficient backtracking from an aggregated alert to its underlying alert instances, allowing on-demand retrieval of detailed
metadata during downstream analysis or investigation.
Figure 3: System architecture of SOCRATES for automated and context-aware alert triage.
4.1.3
Lightweight Risk Scoring and Threshold Filtering
Following aggregation, the resulting alerts differ in their relative importance and investigative priority. This submodule
assigns coarse-grained risk scores to aggregated alerts and
applies threshold-based filtering to determine which alerts
should be forwarded to downstream analysis stages.
Lightweight risk scoring
For each aggregated alert, we
compute a coarse-grained risk score by combining several
lightweight and interpretable scoring components. Each component captures a distinct aspect of alert salience:
Frequency score
(
S
freq
): Quantifies the repetition intensity
of an alert pattern within the aggregation interval. Alerts
with higher occurrence counts or denser inter-arrival patterns yield larger
S
freq
values.
Rule and metadata score
(
S
rule
): Derived from detection
metadata provided by upstream security devices, such as
rule category or
severity
. Alerts associated with higherrisk rules contribute larger
S
rule
values.
Contextual heuristic score
(
S
ctx
): Encodes coarse contextual cues based on readily available metadata, such as
external exposure of the source or sensitivity of the target
asset, without requiring additional context retrieval.
Historical rarity score
(
S
rare
): Reflects how uncommon
an alert pattern is relative to recent history (the past 14
days). Rarely observed patterns receive higher
S
rare
values,
whereas frequently recurring alerts are down-weighted.
Threshold-based filtering and alert forwarding.

unified threat priority score for each aggregated alert. Let

score
rather than a definitive threat verdict. The score is used
solely to rank and filter aggregated alerts: alerts with
S
exceeding a predefined threshold are forwarded to downstream
modules for further analysis, while lower-scoring alerts are
deprioritized or suppressed.
4.2 Business Logic Self-Learning
A primary source of false positives in enterprise SOC environments stems from legitimate business activities that closely
resemble malicious behaviors, such as authorized vulnerability scanning, internal testing, and customized application
workflows. These business-induced alerts are typically persistent, repetitive, and organization-specific, making static rules
and generic threat intelligence largely ineffective. To mitigate
this, we introduce a business logic self-learning module designed to explicitly model enterprise-specific benign patterns
from historical data. As detailed in the following sections, the
module primarily operates through two tightly coupled stages:
(i)
Business Baseline Induction
, which learns stable behavior
prototypes from historical false positives, and (ii)
Business-
Aware Alert Matching
, which leverages trained models to
identify and suppress recurring benign alerts in real-time.
4.2.1 Business Baseline Induction
In the offline stage, we aim to induce a business baseline
that captures recurring benign alert patterns specific to enterprise environments and supports automated suppression of
business-induced false alerts. By learning from historically
confirmed false positives, the induced baseline encodes normal business behavior and provides a foundation for training
a discriminative model to distinguish benign alerts from other
events.

### Feature Extraction

Analysis of real-world SOC data shows
that business-induced false alerts exhibit stable regularities in
structure, semantics, and timing. Motivated by these observations, we extract structural, semantic, and temporal features
to represent each alert.

### Structural Features

Structural features capture the stable
and interpretable attributes of alerts that reflect how detection rules are triggered in enterprise environments. In our
setting, we consider a set of commonly available structural
fields, including the source IP address (
sip
), destination IP
address (
dip
), source and destination ports (
sport
,
dport
),
transport or application-layer protocol (
proto
), the triggering detection rule identifier (
rule_name
), and the accessed
resource or endpoint (
uri
) when applicable. These fields
jointly describe the communication pattern, protocol context,
and detection semantics of an alert. For business-induced false
alerts, such structural attributes tend to remain highly stable
over time, as they are often tied to fixed services, assets, or au-tomated workflows, making them particularly informative for
distinguishing benign business behavior from other alerts. We
apply lightweight and field-specific encoding strategies that
preserve discriminative information while controlling feature
sparsity. Categorical fields such as
proto
and
rule_name
are
encoded using frequency-based representations, allowing the
model to learn rule- or protocol-specific patterns. IP-related
fields (
sip
,
dip
) are transformed into hashed identifiers, to
reduce cardinality while retaining structural consistency. Port
numbers (
sport
,
dport
) are encoded as raw numerical. For
URI fields, we normalize and abstract variable components
(e.g., identifiers or random tokens) into templates and encode
them as categorical features.
Formally, for an alert
a
i
, we denote its encoded structural
representation as
x
str
i
=
f
str
(
sip
i
;
dip
i
;
sport
i
;
dport
i
;
proto
i
;
rule_name
i
;
uri
i
)
:
where
f
str
(
)
represents the collection of field-specific normalization and encoding functions described above. Together,
these encodings yield a compact and structured representation
that enables efficient learning of recurring business-induced
alert patterns.

### Semantic Features

Although business-induced false alerts
may vary significantly in instance-specific parameters, the
core behavioral intent reflected in the alert-triggering content
is often semantically consistent. To capture this consistency,
we focus semantic feature extraction on the
alert payload
, i.e.,
the key protocol messages or traffic fragments that directly
trigger detection rules.
For each alert
a
i
, we extract its normalized payload
payload
i
, which preserves protocol-level grammatical structure while masking volatile and instance-specific fields. The
payload is then encoded using a lightweight pre-trained sentence embedding model to obtain a fixed-length dense representation:
x
sem
i
=
f
sem
(
payload
i
)
;
where
f
sem
(
)
denotes the semantic encoding function and
payload
i
represents the normalized alert payload associated
with
a
i
.

### Temporal Features

Temporal features provide lightweight
calendar-level cues that describe when an alert occurs, which
can help distinguish routine business workflows from irregular activities. In the temporal feature extraction process,
we expand the features derived from the timestamp
t
i
by incorporating both basic and more detailed calendar attributes.
Specifically, we derive the following features: the hour-of-day
h
i
2 f
; : : : ;
g
, indicating the specific hour when the alert
was generated; the day-of-week
d
i
2 f
; : : : ;
g
, representing
the day of the week (MondaySunday); the weekend indicator
w
i
2 f
;
g
, which is set to 1 if the day is Saturday or Sunday, and 0 otherwise; the business-hours indicator
b
i
2 f
;
g
,
which is set to 1 if the hour falls within business hours (default
[
;
)
) and 0 otherwise. In addition to these, we introduce month-of-year
m
i
2 f
; : : : ;
g
, quarter-of-year**
q
i
2 f
;
;
;
g
, an is-holiday indicator
h
holiday
i
2 f
;
g
, and
time since last alert
t
last
i
. To ensure a comprehensive temporal representation, we also include the raw timestamp
@
timestamp
, which allows for accurate chronological mapping.
The complete set of temporal features is then encoded into
a high-dimensional feature vector as follows:
x
tmp
i
=
f
tmp
(
t
i
) =
h
h
i
;
d
i
;
w
i
;
b
i
;
m
i
;
q
i
;
h
holiday
i
;
t
last
i
;
@ts
i
This extended encoding captures both basic and advanced
time-related information, enriching the model's temporal
awareness and improving its ability to differentiate between
normal operational patterns and potential anomalies.

### Business Pattern Prototype Induction

The extracted feature vectors for structural (
x
str
i
), semantic (
x
sem
i
), and temporal
(
x
tmp
i
) modalities differ significantly in dimensionality and
scale. Direct concatenation of these raw vectors may lead to
model bias, where high-dimensional semantic embeddings
dominate the learning process while low-dimensional structural or temporal cues are overshadowed. To mitigate this
heterogeneity, we employ a projection-based alignment strategy. We map each distinct feature vector into a shared latent
space of uniform dimension
D
using modality-specific linear
transformations followed by non-linear activation functions.
Formally, the aligned representations are computed as:
h
str
i
=
ReLU
(
W
s
x
str
i
+
b
s
)
;
h
sem
i
=
ReLU
(
W
e
x
sem
i
+
b
e
)
;
h
tmp
i
=
ReLU
(
W
t
x
tmp
i
+
b
t
)
;
where
W
f
s
;
e
;
t
g
and
b
f
s
;
e
;
t
g
are the learnable weight matrices
and bias vectors for the respective modalities. By projecting
disparate inputs to a uniform dimensionality, we ensure that
each information source contributes equally to the representation capacity. Finally, these aligned vectors are concatenated
to form the unified alert embedding
x
i
:
x
i
= [
h
str
i
k
h
sem
i
k
h
tmp
i
]
:
This composite vector
x
i
serves as the balanced and comprehensive input for the downstream classification model.
We employ XGBoost as the core learner due to its efficiency
in modeling heterogeneous features and robustness to noisy labels without requiring manual normalization. To address class
imbalance, we utilize the
scale_pos_weight
mechanism to
prioritize the identification of minority business-induced false
alerts, ensuring conservative pattern induction. Furthermore,
we adopt a 14-day window for training data selection, which
offers an optimal balance between stability and adaptability;
this duration is sufficient to capture recurring weekly workflows while excluding stale patterns associated with outdated
configurations.
4.2.2 Business-Aware Alert Matching
After the lightweight alert denoising and aggregation stage,
the input to this module consists of aggregated alerts, each
of which represents a group of highly similar raw alerts compressed within a bounded time window. For each aggregated
alert, we leverage its reference field to retrieve the corresponding raw alert instances and recover their original structural, semantic, and temporal information. Each raw alert is then independently encoded using the same feature extraction pipeline
described in the business pattern induction stage and evaluated by the trained XGBoost model, yielding a per-instance
likelihood score that reflects how strongly the alert matches
learned business-induced false alert patterns.
To determine whether an aggregated alert should be classified as a business-induced false alert, we aggregate the
instance-level model outputs into a unified score. Specifically, given an aggregated alert containing a set of raw
alerts
f
a
; : : : ;
a
n
g
with predicted false-alert probabilities
f
s
; : : : ;
s
n
g
, we compute a weighted aggregate score that accounts for both the consistency and prevalence of businesslike behavior within the group. The aggregated alert is classified as a false alert only if its weighted score exceeds a
predefined threshold, ensuring that suppression decisions are
conservative and robust to occasional outliers. Aggregated
alerts that fail to meet this criterion are forwarded to downstream investigation modules for further analysis.
4.3 Context Enhanced LLM Investigation
After the lightweight aggregation and business logic selflearning stages, the remaining alerts represent a small set of
high-value candidates that require in-depth analysis. However,
individual alerts are often insufficient to support reliable security judgments in isolation, as critical evidence is distributed
across assets, historical behaviors, host and network telemetry, and external threat intelligence. To address this limitation,
we introduce a context-enhanced LLM investigation module, which systematically retrieves and integrates alert-centric
contextual information before performing evidence-grounded
reasoning. By coupling large language models with structured
context retrieval and tool-assisted queries, this module emulates the investigative workflow of human SOC analysts and
produces interpretable triage decisions supported by concrete
evidence.
4.3.1 Alert-Centric Context Retrieval
Effective alert triage requires reasoning over contextual information that extends beyond the content of a single alert.
In SOCRATES, we organize alert-centric context into two
complementary categories: external intelligence and internal
enterprise intelligence, which together provide the factual
foundation for downstream LLM-based investigation.

### External Intelligence

External intelligence captures security
knowledge that is independent of a specific enterprise environment but critical for interpreting potential threats. This
includes vulnerability information such as associated CVEs
and affected software versions, IP and domain reputation data
from threat intelligence feeds, as well as adversary tactics,
techniques, and procedures (TTPs) aligned with the MITRE
ATT&CK framework. Such information helps contextualize
whether an observed alert pattern is consistent with known
exploitation behaviors or threat campaigns.

### Internal Enterprise Intelligence

Internal intelligence reflects organization-specific context that is essential for disambiguating benign business activities from genuine attacks.
This category includes asset metadata such as asset groups,
exposure level, business criticality, and ownership, as well as
correlated telemetry from multiple internal data sources. In
particular, we incorporate logs from heterogeneous security
and monitoring systems, including web application logs, endpoint detection and response (EDR) telemetry, authentication
records, and network flow data. These sources provide behavioral and environmental evidence that cannot be inferred from
external knowledge alone.

### Context Retrieval Interface to LLMs

To operationalize the
access to both external and internal intelligence, we implement a unified retrieval layer developed in Python that encapsulates heterogeneous data sources into a set of structured,
callable tools. Rather than embedding massive raw datasets
directly into the prompt, this interface exposes specific investigative capabilitiessuch as querying asset ownership,
searching historical logs within a time window, or validating
IP reputationas standardized API functions. We construct
a comprehensive tool definition registry that is provided to
the LLM within its system prompt. This registry details the
name, functional description, and parameter schema for each
available tool, enabling the model to semantically understand
the utility of each interface. By parsing this definition, the
LLM can autonomously invoke the necessary tools to dynamically gather evidence, ensuring that its reasoning process is
grounded in real-time, retrievable data.
4.3.2 Investigation Workflow
The investigation workflow in SOCRATES is designed to
effectively query and retrieve relevant data from multiple
sources, both internal and external, while ensuring that the
process remains efficient and scalable. The workflow consists
of several key steps:
Retrieving Multi-source Logs.
Our logs are centrally collected and managed via the Elastic platform, where each log
type is assigned a distinct index. To begin the investigation,
we provide sufficient contextual information related to the
logs, which allows the LLM to construct appropriate query
parameters. Based on these parameters, the LLM can query
the corresponding logs from Elastic, retrieving the relevant
entries that align with the specific conditions defined in the
alert. This approach ensures that all internal data sources
are efficiently queried and integrated into the investigation
process.

### Retrieving External Knowledge

To enhance the investigation, we illustrate the process of retrieving external knowledge
using threat intelligence as an example. We leverage platforms
such as Virustotal, a globally recognized threat intelligence
aggregation service. Virustotal offers an API interface that
allows SOCRATES to send queries related to known threats,
domain reputation, or IP addresses. The LLM constructs the
necessary parameters based on the alert's context and sends
a request to the Virustotal API. The query results are then
returned and used to enrich the investigation with up-to-date
external threat intelligence data.

### Overall Process

Upon receiving an alert, the LLM first uses
predefined prompts to assess which tools are available for the
investigation. Based on this assessment, the LLM initiates the
plan phase, in which it outlines the general course of action
for the investigation, identifying which data sources and tools
will be used and in what sequence. After finalizing the plan,
the LLM proceeds with executing the queries as defined in
the plan. To prevent context overload and ensure efficient
reasoning, once a tool is queried and results are returned, the
LLM first independently processes the results, converting the

data into a natural language format. This allows the results
to be meaningfully integrated back into the ongoing context.
The process continues iteratively, where the LLM repeatedly
calls relevant tools, interprets the results, and updates the
context, building on each piece of evidence. Finally, after
all relevant information is gathered and analyzed, the LLM
synthesizes the results into a comprehensive understanding of
the alert, making a final judgment based on the accumulated
evidence. This iterative, evidence-driven workflow ensures
that the investigation remains systematic and accurate while
keeping computational overhead in check.

## 5 Evaluation

In this section, we evaluate SOCRATES to assess its effectiveness and practicality. The evaluation is designed to answer
the following research questions:
RQ3 (Effectiveness):
How does the SOCRATES system
perform in network alert triage?
RQ4 (Comparison):
How does the performance of
SOCRATES compare to existing alert triage systems?
RQ5 (Industrial Deployment):
How does SOCRATES
perform in real-world industrial deployment scenarios?
5.1 Evaluation Setup
5.1.1 Industry Arena Dataset
Most existing alert datasets focus on a single type of security
log or alert source, overlooking the fact that real-world security operations typically rely on correlating signals across multiple heterogeneous data sources. To reflect the operational
reality of SOCs where decisions rely on cross-source correlation, we constructed an Industry Arena Dataset collected from
a production enterprise environment. Unlike existing singlesource datasets, ours comprises six distinct log streams: one
primary IDS alert stream serving as the triage target, and five
auxiliary sources (network, web, and endpoint logs) used exclusively for contextual enrichment. The data spans a 21-day
window, a duration selected to balance the high cost of manual
labeling with the need to capture recurring business behaviors
and periodic attack patterns. All alerts within this period were

rigorously inspected by security analysts to establish reliable
ground truth.
An overview of the resulting dataset is summarized inTable 3. In total, the dataset comprises over 70 million log entries collected over a 21-day period, occupying approximately
~286 GB of raw data and spanning heterogeneous security
domains, including intrusion alerts, network traffic inspection, web application activity, and endpoint security events.
The primary alert stream alone contains more than 9.4 million alerts, reflecting the high-volume and high-noise nature
of real-world SOC environments. In contrast, the auxiliary
logs collectively contribute over 60 million additional records,
providing rich and diverse contextual signals.

5.2 RQ3: Effectiveness of SOCRATES
We first evaluate the overall effectiveness and efficiency of
SOCRATES in real-world alert triage. The results demonstrate that SOCRATES is able to substantially reduce alert
noise while preserving detection capability, and achieve practical efficiency suitable for large-scale SOC environments.

### Alert Reduction

The primary objective of SOCRATES' alert
triage system is to significantly reduce the number of alerts
without sacrificing the ability to detect genuine threats. As
shown inTable 4, the aggregation rate of Module 1 is consistently high, ranging from 94.04% to 95.01% across different
days, reflecting the system's efficiency in consolidating redundant alerts. Additionally, the noise reduction rate achieved
by Module 2 further demonstrates SOCRATES' capability to
filter out irrelevant or benign alerts, with reductions varying
between 89.43% and 99.42%. For instance, on Day 6, Module 2 managed to reduce the alert count from 12,826 to just
75, showcasing its strength in eliminating non-critical alerts,
thereby enabling SOC analysts to focus on high-value events.

### Accurate Identification of Business False Positives

SOCRATES excels in distinguishing between legitimate business activities and actual attacks, addressing a significant
challenge in modern SOCs. As seen in the data, Module 2 effectively suppresses business-induced false positives, leading
to a marked decrease in false alarm alerts. The number of attack alerts remains stable across both Module 1 and Module 2,
with minimal variation in the attack count (e.g., Day 1: 7,945
vs. 7,941). However, Module 2 substantially reduces the false
positive alerts, with the number of false alarms dropping from
265,879 to 5,291 on Day 1. This indicates that the system
accurately identifies benign business behaviors and removes
them without mistakenly flagging real attacks, ensuring high

Effectiveness of Module 3.
With Module 2 effectively filtering out business-induced false positives that are challenging for large models to identify, and Module 3 providing
the remaining alerts with enriched contextual information,
SOCRATES significantly enhances the accuracy of its triage
decisions. The addition of relevant context allows the LLM
to better interpret ambiguous alerts, leading to a substantial
reduction in the false positive rate. Notably, the TPR remains
stable across all days, indicating that the system consistently
identifies the vast majority of actual attacks. For instance, on
average, the FPR across all days is reduced to 19.35%, with
Day 5 exhibiting a notably low FPR of just 14.88%. This
demonstrates how SOCRATES balances high detection rates
with a significant reduction in false alarms by leveraging both
reduced alert volume and enhanced context in Module 3.
5.3
RQ4: Comparison with Existing Technologies
In this section, we compare the performance of SOCRATES
with existing approaches in the field of network alert triage.
Comparison with Alert Throttling
Alert throttling is a commonly used noise-reduction technique in enterprise environments. This method works by suppressing repeated alerts
from the same source within a specific time window, typically
after a predefined threshold of occurrences. The goal is to
prevent the system from continuously flagging the same event
and reduce the alert volume. The main advantage of alert throttling is its simplicity and quick effectiveness in minimizing
alert overload. However, its drawback lies in the possibility of
missing actual attacks that exhibit similar patterns but occur
at irregular intervals, as throttling may inadvertently suppress
legitimate alerts in such cases.
To quantify the advantages of our semantic-aware approach over traditional volume-based heuristics, we compared
SOCRATES with four standard alert throttling configurations
(Exp 1-4). As detailed inTable 5, heuristic throttling exhibits a fundamental conflict between noise reduction and
detection recall. For instance, the aggressive configuration
in Exp 2 achieved a moderate benign reduction of 52.73%,
but this came at a catastrophic cost: suppressing 84.36% of
genuine attack alerts. In contrast, SOCRATES effectively
breaks this trade-off by leveraging coarse-to-fine semantic
filtering. As shown in the bottom row ofTable 5, our system
achieves a superior benign reduction rate of 97.78%, filtering
out nearly 1.85 million false positives. Crucially, this massive noise reduction does not compromise security visibility:
SOCRATES retains 99.63% of true attacks, with an attack
loss rate of only 0.37% (187 alerts). These results demonstrate that SOCRATES can distinguish between benign repetitive business behaviors and malicious high-frequency attacks,
providing a level of precision that simple frequency-based
throttling cannot match.

### Comparison with Standalone LLMs

To demonstrate the necessity of our architectural design, we compare SOCRATES
with the standalone LLM architecture evaluated in 3. As
summarized inTable 6, compared to the standalone baseline,
our system achieves a superior balance between detection
recall and precision. While the standalone model suffers from
a prohibitive FPR of 40.70%, SOCRATES drastically reduces
this to 19.35% while maintaining a high TPR of 90.67%, resulting in an improved F1-score of 82.48%. This performance
leap highlights the distinct contributions of our modules: Module 2 effectively identifies enterprise-specific benign patterns
to suppress noise, while Module 3 equips the LLM with retrieved evidence to support robust, context-grounded reasoning.
Comparison with State-of-the-Art Approaches.
To evaluate the standing of SOCRATES in the current research landscape, we conduct a comparative analysis against three representative state-of-the-art triage systems: DEEPCASE [36],
CALLEE [20], and the stream-supervised approach [35]. It
is critical to note that since these frameworks were evaluated
on distinct, proprietary industrial datasets (e.g., the Lastline
dataset or private ISP logs) that are not publicly accessible,
a direct experimental reproduction under a unified environment is infeasible. Therefore, we evaluate SOCRATES by
cross-referencing the performance metrics reported in their respective original publications and qualitatively assessing their
architectural capabilities, as summarized inTable 7. While ex-

isting methods achieve significant workload reduction through
statistical pattern matching or deep learning, they primarily
operate as black boxes limited to local context. DEEPCASE
utilizes temporal sequences but lacks semantic depth, and
CALLEE achieves the highest volume reduction (99.76%)
via graph clustering but assumes that structural similarity
equates to malicious intent, which may fail in complex enterprise environments. In contrast, SOCRATES bridges this
gap by leveraging LLMs for deep semantic understanding of
alert payloads. Our system is the only one capable of incorporating global context, such as external threat intelligence
and internal asset sensitivity, into the reasoning process. This
allows SOCRATES to maintain a high F1-score of 0.91 while
providing human-readable explanations, effectively reducing
the cognitive load on SOC analysts beyond simple alert suppression.
5.4 RQ5: Industrial Deployment
By the time of this writing, SOCRATES has been deployed
within the SOC of a large-scale enterprise for over one year,
monitoring a network infrastructure consisting of more than
10,000 endpoint devices. During this extended deployment,
the system has demonstrated exceptional stability under highthroughput conditions, processing an average of over one million raw alerts daily. By effectively filtering benign anomalies
and aggregating redundant events, SOCRATES achieves a
remarkable alert noise reduction rate of 99.6%, which has
translated into a reduction in manual investigation effort by
more than 80%. These real-world operational results confirm

### Architectural Paradigm and Strategic Value

The design
of SOCRATES underscores a critical shift in automated security operations: the transition from static alert filtration
to dynamic, context-aware investigation. Our research reveals that the primary bottleneck in applying LLMs to cybersecurity is not their inherent reasoning capability, but the
scarcity of enterprise-specific context and the prohibitive cost
of processing high-volume noise. By decoupling the suppression of repetitive business behaviorshandled efficiently by
lightweight machine learningfrom the semantic analysis
of complex threats, we establish a scalable paradigm for AIhuman collaboration. This hybrid architecture demonstrates
that effective automation requires more than just powerful
models; it demands an architectural alignment with the operational reality of SOCs, where understanding legitimate
business logic is often a prerequisite for identifying genuine
anomalies. By mimicking the tiered workflow of human analysts, the system bridges the gap between the speed of heuristic detection and the depth of cognitive reasoning.

### Limitations

Despite these advancements, SOCRATES is
subject to certain limitations that warrant future investigation.
The efficacy of the Business Self-Learning module is contingent upon the availability of high-quality historical data and
reliable analyst verdicts. In newly established SOC environments or rapidly evolving network infrastructures, the system
may initially suffer from a cold start problem until a sufficient baseline of business behaviors is induced. Additionally,
while the evidence-driven reasoning mechanism enhances interpretability, the upper bound of the LLM's decision-making
quality is strictly defined by the completeness and freshness
of the retrieved context. Fragmented logs or outdated threat
intelligence can still lead to inconclusive or conservative judgments.

## 7 Conclusion

In this paper, we propose SOCRATES, an AI-powered SOC
agent designed for automated and scalable network alert triage
in large-scale enterprise environments. By innovatively utilizing a staged, coarse-to-fine pipeline that combines adaptive
business logic learning with context-grounded LLM investigation, SOCRATES effectively minimizes alert fatigue while
preserving high detection integrity. The successful long-term
deployment in a production SOC and its proven track record
in substantially reducing manual investigation effort further
attest to its robustness and practical scalability. In conclusion, SOCRATES offers a promising paradigm for enhancing
the efficiency and intelligence of modern security operations
against the increasingly complex threat landscape.
A Ethical Considerations
This work investigates automated network alert triage in enterprise SOCs, a setting where errors and misuse may have operational and privacy implications. We adopt a stakeholder-based
ethical analysis, considering SOC analysts, enterprise users,
and partner organizations as primary stakeholders. The study
relies on real-world enterprise security telemetry; all data are
handled under strict access control and de-identification policies, and only aggregated statistics and sanitized examples are
reported. To mitigate potential harm from misclassification,
the proposed system is designed as a decision-support tool
rather than a fully autonomous response system, with conservative filtering, evidence-grounded reasoning, and explicit
support for human oversight. We do not make judgments
about individuals, and the system's outputs are limited to
alert-level assessments. Overall, we believe the benefits of
reducing alert fatigue and improving SOC scalability outweigh the residual risks, given the conservative design and
deployment assumptions.
B Open Science
To support reproducibility and future research, we have released the source code, data preprocessing scripts, and model
configurations used in this study. However, due to strict privacy regulations and security non-disclosure agreements, the
raw enterprise datasets, including network alert logs, detailed
asset inventories, and historical incident tickets, cannot be
publicly disclosed. To address this limitation while preserving the utility of our artifacts, we provide sanitized samples
and mock-up data that reflect the schema and structure of
the original dataset. All related materials are available at
https://anonymous.4open.science/r/socagent
.
C Prompt Templates
To ensure reproducibility and transparency, we provide the
detailed prompt designs used in our experimental evaluation.
We adopted a modular prompting framework, utilizing a fixed
Zero-Shot Baseline
as the foundation. Other strategies were
implemented by injecting specific functional modules into
this baseline:
Expertise Strategy
: Injects a domain knowledge module into the system prompt to define specific analysis
markers.
Few-Shot Strategy
: Inserts authentic demonstration examples (one True Attack and one False Positive) before
the user input to leverage in-context learning.
Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
: Modifies the output instruction to enforce a step-by-step reasoning process before
the final verdict.
Figure 4illustrates this incremental design, clearly marking
the baseline components and the optional modules added for
each strategy.
Modular Prompt Structure Construction
[System Prompt (Base: Zero-Shot)]
You are a senior network security analyst. Your task is
to analyze the following network alert logs.
+ Module A: Expertise (Injects Domain Rules)
# Simplified Markers for Analysis:
1. Attack Signatures: Look for known patterns like
SQL injection ('UNION SELECT'), directory traversal
('../')...
2. Benign Patterns: Identify standard business
behaviors...
3. Contextual Indicators: Consider response codes...
+ Module B: Few-Shot (Injects Demonstrations)
Here are two examples of how to analyze the alerts:
Example 1 (True Attack): Input: {...} Output: {...}
Example 2 (False Positive): Input: {...} Output: {...}
+ Module C: CoT (Modifies Output Requirement)
# Reasoning Requirement:
Before providing the classification, explicit
step-by-step analysis is required:
1. Analyze payload content... 2. Check status...
Output Format: <Step-by-step Reasoning> followed by
